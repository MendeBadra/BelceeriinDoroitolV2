# Belceeriin doroitol project repo

This is a git repo of my project of evaluating the Land degradation in Mongolia. The main idea is to classify, using image processing techniques, weeds and bare ground and assume the remaining part is healthy plant.

## Data

## TODO
- [ ] Encorporate last summer's internship progress `Dadlaga_2024`.
- [ ] Commit from `razydave_pc` to update to latest progress.
- [ ] Clean up the repo, make it have some sort of structure.
- [ ] 

Data is the Drone Orthomosaics but it has been untracked since it is too large.

## Code
Main code is the `cli_gabor_segmentat_of_tiff_indir.py` which is a command line interface for segmenting the orthomosaics.
(Maybe need to rename it to much more meaningful name).

## Results

Results are `Plots` folder and also Results with Drone classification.
