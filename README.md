# BelceeriinDoroitolV2 â€“ Land Degradation Evaluation in Mongolia

This repository contains my **Bachelorâ€™s thesis project** on evaluating pastureland degradation in Hustai National Park, Mongolia, using **multispectral drone imagery** and **image processing techniques**.

The system classifies orthomosaic images into **grass**, **weeds**, and **bare soil**, enabling automated assessment of land condition. The workflow reduces reliance on manual field surveys, potentially saving **hundreds of man-hours** in ecosystem research.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Overview

* **`experiments/`** â€“ Jupyter notebooks and scripts for testing segmentation and classification methods.
* **`reflectance_msavi_threshold/`** â€“ Core implementation of reflectance calibration, vegetation index (MSAVI) computation, and threshold-based segmentation.
* **`gabor_src/`** â€“ Early texture-based methods (Gabor filters) by previous students.
* **`outputs/`** â€“ Processed results and classification visualizations.
* **`data/`** â€“ References to raw and processed datasets (not included due to size).
* **`tutorials/`** â€“ Supplementary material (e.g., Landsat segmentation, MONAI medical segmentation tutorial).

## ðŸš€ Key Features

* Automated **image alignment** and preprocessing.
* Reflectance normalization using DJI Phantom 4 multispectral drone sun sensor data.
* **MSAVI-based vegetation index analysis** for degraded land detection.
* Experimentation with:

  * KMeans clustering
  * Random Forests
  * Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA)
  * Early deep learning models (FastAI, ViTs)
* Compatible with **QGIS** and **OpenDroneMap (ODM)** outputs.

## ðŸ“Š Results

* Clear separation of **healthy vegetation vs. degraded land**.
* Thresholding + MSAVI normalization improved robustness across acquisition dates.
* Prototype demonstrated feasibility of replacing large-scale manual surveys.

Example workflow:

```bash
python cli_segmentation.py \
    --input data/raw/Drone_Orthomosaics/Best_2024.tif \
    --output outputs/results/Best_2024_segmented.tif \
    --method msavi-threshold
```
